# Student Calander application was developed using Amazon cloud services where client software was done for iOS and web server was developed using PHP and MySQL.

This application was done during my second work placement and a complete work placement was carried out as startup project. We started this project from the brainstorming of the project idea. Scrum methodology was use to facilitate the development process. The workspace setup was done using Git as version control system and Manthis was used for bug tracking.

During this project I contributed mostly for the client software but I was responsible for both client and Mysql database design. I also worked to create mobile web services (i.e. pull_data1.php) for the communication between web server and iOS client. Client application was developed using Objective C programming language.
